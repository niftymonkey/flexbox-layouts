# Flexbox Layouts
Examples of common layouts I've encountered, solved via CSS3 Flexbox

This is a playground for learning flexbox-based layouts in a hands-on way.  I intend to solve layout needs that I've regularly encountered when building web applications via the use of flexbox

> Hey buddy, haven't you seen the Solved By Flexbox [site][1] and [repo][2]? 

Yep, I have actually.  That was what prompted me to create this repo.  First of all, that's a really great resource that I'll likely reference a lot.  Here's why I'm putting these here:  

* I enjoy building these step by step myself so that I can better learn them. 
* I'd like to separate flexbox based styles from other styles in each example to make sure it's clear what properties are for layout and what properties are for show
* While I'm a really big fan of [Sass][3], I'd like to keep this repository to simple CSS for clarity
